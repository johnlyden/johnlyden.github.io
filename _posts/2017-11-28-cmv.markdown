Its hard to hear an argument that goes against something you think you believe and be open to hearing that side of things clearly.  Theres this subreddit called [change my view](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/) and its really cool becasue its a forum to have discussions about really polarizing topics in a way that just tries to explain each side in a rational, factual manner.  There are specific rules to the subreddit that are meant to eliminate any type of non-productive discussion.  I really like
it.
