Well, I have been living in Austin, Texas now for about two weeks and it's pretty cool.  My wife and I are staying in a little furnished apartment on top of this woman's garage.  Its nice and small and kinda reminds me of a little box in New York.

Lina has completed her first week at Dev Bootcamp here (which is the reason we are here) and she is loving it.  I love talking to her about coding and shert like that - its pretty neat.  Welp, CYA!
