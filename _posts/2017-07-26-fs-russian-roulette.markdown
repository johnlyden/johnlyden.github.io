# Warning: This is a horrible idea - Don't do this.

Linux users - Want to feel alive?  Want to play a game that will take you to the edge and back? Play a little Russian roulette with something worth losing - all the shit on your computer.

```
[ $[ $RANDOM % 6 ] == 0 ] && rm *.* || echo "You live" 
```
Execute this command and try your luck...or stupidity, bc rlly what do you have to gain by doing this?
