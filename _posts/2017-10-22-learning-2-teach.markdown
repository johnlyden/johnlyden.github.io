Its been a crazy last 3-4 months - My wife is coming into her 6th week at Dev Bootcamp and she been coding from sun up to damn near midnight.  Its been really cool to talk about all this stuff wit her and all the things we want to work on together.  I'm really liking it...helping her learn has helped me learn too.  Well, time 4 bed.
