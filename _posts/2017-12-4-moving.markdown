Hey, we just signed a lease here in Austin, Texas.  Lina and I will be Texans for the next 12 months.  This is exciting - coordinating the move of all your shit from a storage unit in NC to an apartment in TX has been a real blast.  Thank God for good friends to help you out.  Hopefully by next post, we will have our own bed to sleep in.  peace.
