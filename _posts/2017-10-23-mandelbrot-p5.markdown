> The image above is the "spider" or "bug" that will continue to appear throughout the Set, no matter how far it is magnified, or "zoomed into".  Coined as the THUMBPRINT OF GOD, each MANDELBROT BUG is a near copy of the original, yet is an individual UNIVERSE unto itself with subtle and original variations.  One could eXplore the above image FOREVER and still see new worlds.  In fact, you can actually "zoom in" to the Set as seen above until the original image is larger than the UNIVERSE itself!  Truly, it is an equation of INFINITY.

I decided to partake in a coding challenge to create a Mandelbrot image using Javascript and p5.js.  You can check out the [github repo here](https://github.com/johnlyden/mandelbrot-js) or view the [Mandelbrot image I made here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/johnlyden/mandelbrot-js/blob/master/index.html)
